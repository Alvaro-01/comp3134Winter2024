Scenario 1: Input Ben
Input: Typing Ben into the form.
Observation: The script will execute a query to search for users whose first name is exactly Ben and are active (active = 1).
Outcome: Any users with the first name Ben and active = 1, 
those user details will be displayed in the table.

Scenario 2: Input Ben'--
Observation: The script will execute a query with the input string Ben'--, 
effectively commenting out the rest of the SQL query.
Outcome: The SQL query ignores everything after the single quote (') and two dashes (--), potentially returning all users regardless of their active status.


Scenario 3: Input Ben' or 1=1
Observation: The script will execute a query with the input string Ben' or 1=1, causing the WHERE clause of the SQL query to always evaluate to true.
Outcome: The SQL query returns all users because 1=1 is always true, bypassing the intended active = 1 condition.
