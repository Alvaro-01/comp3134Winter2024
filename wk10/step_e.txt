Steps to Mitigate:
Viewing Files and Folders Before HTML Directory:

Use realpath() to resolve the full path.
Check if the resolved path is within the allowed base directory.
Preventing Access to Nonexistent Folders:

Use file_exists() to verify if the resolved path exists before proceeding.
Disallow Passing a Filename Directly (Bonus):

Check for the presence of a dot (.) in the parameter value to avoid directly passing filenames.
